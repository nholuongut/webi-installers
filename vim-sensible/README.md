### Files

These are the files / directories that are created and/or modified with this
install:

```text
~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-sensible/
~/.vim/plugins/sensible.vim
~/.vimrc
```

## Updating `vim-sensible`

```sh
webi vim-sensible
```

## Cheat Sheet

> Think of sensible.vim as one step above 'nocompatible' mode: a universal set
> of defaults that (hopefully) everyone can agree on.

Installs to `$HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start`.

It just works.
