## Updating rustlang

```sh
rustup update
```

You can `rustup use x.y.z` for a specific version or toolchain.

### Files

These are the files / directories that are created and/or modified with this
install:

```text
~/.config/envman/PATH.env
~/.cargo/
~/.rustup/
<PROJECT-DIR>/Cargo.toml
<PROJECT-DIR>/src/main.rs
<PROJECT-DIR>/src/lib.rs
```

## Cheat Sheet

> Rust is what C++ and D were trying to do, but didn't. It's a modern, safe,
> high-performance language, which also just so happens to be used to build all
> of your favorite CLI tools, such as:

- rg (ripgrep, modern grep)
- fd (modern find)
- sd (modern sed)
- lsd (modern ls)
- bat (modern cat)

### Install rust from rust.rs

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Hello World

```sh
cargo install ripgrep
```

```sh
cargo new hello --bin
pushd ./hello/
cargo build --release
./target/release/hello
> "Hello, world!"
```
