  Gitea: Git with a cup of tea, painless self-hosted git service.
---

To update or switch versions, run `webi gitea@stable` (or `@v1.14`, `@beta`,
etc).

**Windows users**: You must [install git](/git) first.

### Files

These are the files / directories that are created and/or modified with this
install:

```text
~/.config/envman/PATH.env
~/.local/opt/gitea/
```

## Cheat Sheet

> Gitea is a clean, lightweight self-hosted Github clone. It only uses a few
> megabytes of RAM so it's perfect for hosting git on small VPSes and Raspberry
> Pis. It's forked from Gogs, and very familiar user-friendly for Github users
> in comparison to Gitlab or Bitbucket.

### How to run `gitea`

```sh
gitea web --config ~/.local/opt/gitea/custom/conf/app.ini
```

Note: `gitea` does NOT respect the _current working directory_ - the `./custom/`
folder must always exist in the location of the binary, which will be
`~/.local/opt/gitea/`.
