again.

```sh
source ~/.iterm2_shell_integration.bash
```

## Cheat Sheet

> iTerm2 may be integrated with the unix shell so that it can keep track of your
> command history, current working directory, host name, and moreâ€”even over ssh.

This downloads and runs the same exact script that runs if you select the
_iTerm2>Install Shell Integration_ menu item.\
(the advantage being that you can use the CLI! _Look ma', no GUI!_)

In addition to enabling [automatic profile switching](./iterm2), the following
utilities will also be installed.
